<here i wrote all think learned aboud github and git language step by step>
uploade the directory to the github :
in computer file open the cmd :
>git init (to creat github referance)
>git status (to show the files in computer directory)
>git add file.type (add file.type to the Repository)
>git add . (with '.' add all files in computer directory)
>git commit -m "commit_name" (give a name to commit)
>git branch -M btanch_name (to create main branch and if i didnt create a branch its created by default with 'm aster' name)
>git remote add origin http://github.com/repositorylink (connect with repository )
Well with this steps we create and connect out computer directory with github

>git push -u origin main


Update the github files if we have any changed :
- check if we have a changed 
   >git status
   >git add .
   >git commit -m "Second Commit"
   >git push 


Download Github to computer directory (clone):
>git clone https://github.com/downloadingfile


To Clear Commit file :
>git reset --soft HEAD~1

To check update in my computer file: 
git pull
